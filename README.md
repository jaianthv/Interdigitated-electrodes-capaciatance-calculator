# Interdigitated-electrodes-capaciatance-calculator

Calculating capacitance of interdigitated electrodes is not strightforwad, espicially when it is designed to be used as a senor or for generating surface acoustic wave. With this code, one need to input the capacitor dimentions and the necessary dielectric permitivitty and it calulates the capacitance of the electrode when embedded in to a dielectric or on top of the dielectric.
